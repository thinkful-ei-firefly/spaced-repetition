This is an app to help people learn basic Japanese through spaced repetition. It presents the user with various words and
they must guess what the translation of the word is. They are shown if they were correct and the correct translation if
they were not correct, and can move onto another word.


The site uses various url's to display information.
"/register" is where a new user can create an account, with a display name, user name, and password
"/login" is where users can log in to the server to access their scores
"/" is the homepage that displays your username, the words you are trying to learn, and their respective scores
"/learn"  is the core of the spaced repetition learning. It displays a word in Japanese and prompts the user
  to submit the english translation.
